Scientists' research has revealed that viruses are by far the most abundant life forms on Earth. There are a million
times more viruses on the planet than stars in the universe. Viruses also harbor the majority of genetic diversity on
Earth. Scientists are finding evidence of viruses as a planetary force, influencing the global climate and geochemical
cycles. They have also profoundly shaped the evolution of their hosts. The human genome, for example, contains 100,000
segments of virus DNA.
When mice are kept at high population densities, their behaviour changes in a number of ways. Aggressive activity
within populations of mice rises as density increases. Cannibalism of young also goes up, and so does aberrant sexual
activity. Communal nesting, frequent in natural mouse populations, increases abnormally. In one example, 58 mice one to
three days old (from several litters) were found in one nest, most unusual communal living. None survived because most
of the mothers deserted them immediately after birth.
